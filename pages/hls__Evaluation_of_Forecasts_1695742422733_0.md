- Table Ib contains overall measures of accuracy and skill (these measures involve the forecasts and observations for all three categories). The measure of accuracy is the ranked probability score (RPS) (Epstein 1969; Murphy 1971), a mean-square-error measure defined as the average squared difference between the forecasts and observations after they have been translated into empirical cumulative distribution functions. The skill score (SS) represents the fractional improvement in the RPS of the forecasts over the RPS of constant forecasts based solely on historical climatological probabilities. The latter indicates a 4%(1 %) improvement in the case of the MT (MP) forecasts.
